Slide 1: Title

StealthShield-Mid: The First Multifunctional Aerospace Skin
Unknown-pixel + Qwen • 2025 

 Slide 2: The Gap

“No existing material combines stealth, radiation shielding, and high-temp performance in one structural system.” 

F-35: Stealth ✅, Radiation ❌, Temp ❌
PICA-X: Temp ✅, Stealth ❌, Structure ❌
JAXA Rad Panel: Radiation ✅, Stealth ❌, Temp ❌
 Slide 3: Our Solution

StealthShield-Mid CFRP Hybrid 

RCS: -16.8 dB
Shielding: 89% n / 28% γ
Temp: 308°C
Cost: $330/kg
Weight: 5.85 kg/m²
 Slide 4: Architecture

[Insert figure: Layer stack schematic] 

T800/CE CFRP
Gd₂O₃ + B₄C interleaf
Embedded Cu FSS @ λ/4 depth
 Slide 5: Why 9.5% FSS?

[Insert figure: FSS vs RCS curve] 

8% → -14.2 dB
9.5% → -16.8 dB (+2.6 dB = 45% less radar return)
18% → -24.0 dB (cost ↑ 2.7x for +7.2 dB)
